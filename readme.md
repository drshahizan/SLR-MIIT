## Session 1
### [1. Literature search](./materials/s1-lit-search.md)
Literature search, a crucial aspect of academic research, involves the systematic exploration and retrieval of relevant scholarly information to support a particular topic or inquiry. Researchers employ various tools and databases to conduct comprehensive searches. [**Scopus**](scopus.md) and [**Web of Science**](web-of-science.md) are renowned multidisciplinary databases providing access to a wide array of academic literature, while [**Google Scholar**](google-scholar.md) offers a user-friendly interface for a broad search across disciplines. [**Semantic Scholar**](semantic-scholar.md) employs artificial intelligence to enhance search precision, while [**PubMed**](pubmed/) specializes in biomedical and life sciences. [**EvidenceHunt**](pubmed/evidence-hunt.md) is a platform facilitating evidence-based research ([EvidenceHunt](https://evidencehunt.com/)), and [**Publish or Perish**](publish-or-perish.md) evaluates research impact using citation metrics. [**Zeta Alpha**](zeta-alpha.md), [**Consensus.app**](consensus.app.md), and [**Elicit**](elicit.md) are emerging platforms offering collaborative research and decision-making functionalities. Additionally, [**scite.ai**](scite-ai.md) aids researchers in assessing the reliability of scientific claims through citation analysis. This diverse array of tools caters to researchers' needs, offering a spectrum of options for efficient literature exploration and retrieval.

### [2. Copywriting with ChatGPT](./materials/s1-1copywriting.md)
Exploring **copywriting** with **ChatGPT** from an **academic perspective** means looking at how **artificial intelligence (AI)** and writing work together. **ChatGPT**, an advanced language tool, changes how we create **writing**. By using smart computer programs and lots of information, this **AI** can create detailed and fitting **writing** based on what users ask. Looking at this from an **academic view** helps us understand how **ChatGPT** handles language intricacies and adjusts to different **writing styles**. It gives us a better picture of how technology and language connect. This **academic study** not only shows the potential of **AI-driven writing** in changing how we create **content** but also makes us think about important things like ethics, language details, and how human creativity fits into a world with smart machines.

### [3. Chatbot and Detecting AI-Generated Content](./materials/s1-2ai_tools.md)
**Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools** have become integral in various domains, revolutionizing the way tasks are performed and boosting efficiency. Among the noteworthy tools are [**AIPRM for ChatGPT**](https://www.aiprm.com/), which facilitates prompt management and community-driven prompt libraries for diverse tasks. [**ChatGPT Writer**](https://chatgptwriter.ai/), a Chrome extension, harnesses [**ChatGPT AI**](https://chatgpt.com/) to generate emails or replies based on user-inputted keywords. [**ChatGPT for Google**](https://chatgpt4google.com/), a browser extension, enhances search engines by displaying [**ChatGPT responses**](https://chatgpt.com/) alongside regular search results. [**Bard AI**](https://bard.google.com/chat), an experimental Google service, functions similarly to [**ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/) but pulls information from the web. [**Bing Chat**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/bing-chat), powered by [**OpenAI's GPT-4 technology**](https://openai.com/), is a conversational AI chatbot for Bing's search engine. [**GPTZero**](https://gptzero.me/), a [**Generative Pre-trained Transformer model**](https://www.openai.com/), has significantly impacted natural language processing tasks. [**DetectAI tools**](https://copyleaks.com/ai-content-detector) include [**Copyleaks**](https://copyleaks.com/ai-content-detector), a plagiarism checker, and [**Hello-SimpleAI's ChatGPT Detector**](https://copyleaks.com/ai-content-detector), designed to identify text generated by [**ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/). [**GPT-Minus1**](https://www.gptminus1.com/) is a creative tool that randomly replaces words with synonyms, while [**QuillBot**](https://quillbot.com/) is an AI-powered writing assistant offering paraphrasing and grammar improvement. [**Spinbot**](https://spinbot.com/), another paraphrasing tool, uses AI to rewrite text, and [**Grammarly**](https://www.grammarly.com/) serves as a comprehensive digital writing assistant. These tools collectively showcase the diverse applications and capabilities of **AI** in streamlining various tasks across different sectors.
